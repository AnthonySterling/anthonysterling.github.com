A few months ago, after more than 4 years working with the [Drummond Central] team as their Technical Director, I decided that it was time to start looking for new challenges. It wasn't an easy decision to make, the Drummond Central team are fantastic and we've delivered some great projects together during my time there.

My plan was to perform handovers, tie up loose ends throughout October and November, and spend December enjoying Christmas with my family. Once the New Year arrived I would then start to think about what challenges I would like for the next few years.

However, following [the announcement][Tweet] of my plans on Twitter, I was approached by the [Moltin][Moltin] team asking if we could meet up to discuss their plans for the future.

If you've not heard of Moltin before, they graduated from the [Ignite 100][Ignite 100] accelerator programme back in December 2013 with a vision to deliver an API based eCommerce solution that allows the integration of inventory, carts, and checkout flow into any website or application.

I was bowled over by the passion and vision of the Moltin team. They have some big, ambitious, plans to change the way we do eCommerce and have some unique challenges that I'd love to be involved in.

I'm really happy to to say that, from Monday the 7th December, I'll be joining [Moltin][Moltin] full-time as their Head of Platform - where I'll be working with the development and management teams to help support and architect new systems, features, enhancements, and infrastructure.

2016 is going to be great fun.
