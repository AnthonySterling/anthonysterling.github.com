title: Inline Puppet Manifest With Vagrant
date: 2015-08-12
---

I'm a huge fan of [Vagrant][1], it allows me to quicky test applications and proposed architectures with minimal fuss and, with a provisioner, in a way that's reproducible for myself and others.

Vagrant supports many [provisioners][2], but I tend to stick with [shell][3] and [Puppet][4]. Shell provides a nice quick way of hacking together something that Just Worksâ„¢, but it's hard to get shell to be robust and idempotent which is why I prefer Puppet.

Sadly Vagrant doesn't provide a way to supply an inline [manifest][4] like it does with the [shell][4] provisioner. This means that for simple environments you have to create/specify a location for the manifest file or have it within the root of the project.

If you're looking for a quick way to get a simple inline Puppet manifest in Vagrant, here's a simple (albeit [Fugly][5]) way to do this.

{% highlight ruby %}

$manifest = <<PUPPET

	Exec {
	    path => ['/usr/bin', '/bin', '/usr/sbin', '/sbin', '/usr/local/bin', '/usr/local/sbin']
	}

	exec { 'apt-get update':
	    command => 'apt-get -qq -y update --fix-missing',
	    unless  => 'grep -F `date +"%y-%m-%d"` /var/log/apt/history.log'
	}

	package { 'build-essential':
	    ensure  => present,
	    name    => 'build-essential',
	    require => Exec['apt-get update']
	}

PUPPET

def inline_puppet(manifest, file = "provision.pp")
	require 'base64'
	"echo '#{Base64.strict_encode64(manifest)}' | base64 --decode > /tmp/#{file} && puppet apply -v /tmp/#{file}"
end

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
	config.vm.box = "trusty64"
	config.vm.box_url = "http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/vagrant/trusty/current/trusty-server-cloudimg-amd64-vagrant-disk1.box"
	config.vm.provision :shell, :inline => inline_puppet($manifest)

end

{% endhighlight %}

Let me walk you though what happens.

We create a variable in the Vagrantfile to hold the Puppet manifest, and then define a function called `inline_puppet`. The function creates an shell command that:-

1. Base64 encodes the content of `$manifest` using the Base64 module in Ruby so we don't have to worry about escaping it for the shell
2. Uses `base64` to decode the encoded manifest
3. Writes the decoded content to a file to in the `/tmp` directory of the Vagrant box
4. Instructs Puppet to apply the manifest to the Vagrant box

We then use the built-in inline shell functionality of Vagrant to execute this shell command.

It's not great, but it's a simple way to have a standalone Vagrantfile with Puppet functionality.
